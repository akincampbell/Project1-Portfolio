    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
    My interest in software development started young: making a website for a gaming community in middle school with the no code tool Wix and programming a game with my dad. Since then I have expressed a strong interest in technology, specifically software. I knew I wanted to be a software engineer when I took AP Computer Science in high school (and passed exam). My senior year of high school I completed an iOS development class. I was then admitted to a bachelors in computer science at the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities (UMN). In addition to education, I have been doing web and app development for 8 years and have done projects that apply technical skills such as HTML, CSS, JS, Java, Swift, Python, php, SQL and writing queries, device debugging with chrome for responsive websites, JQuery/AJAX and Ruby [trained by DPI’s Intro to Coding course]. I have also been participating in computer science research in the <a href="https://grouplens.org/">GroupLens lab</a> (the UMN social computing lab) at the UMN, TC since my senior year of high school. A few other highlights of my computer science career are being selected by Google for an exclusive program named Google CodeU; being a IBM, Target and Agosto software engineer intern and knowledgeable of multiple programming languages. I’ve also done more full-time industry software work for 2-3 years after college.
